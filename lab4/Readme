Project: LAB4 -- Symbol Table with YACC 

This project builds upon the concepts of compilation by incorporating advanced data types into the YACC stack and integrating a symbol table introduced 
in a previous assignment. The objective of this project is to enhance Lab2.2 by introducing a Lab3 symbol table system. 
This enhancement involves replacing register names with more flexible variable names, enforcing variable 
declaration before usage, and assigning memory locations to each declared variable. To achieve these goals, the project extends 
the Context-Free Grammar of the calculator, modifies the LEX program to recognize variable names, updates YACC directives to 
handle symbol table storage and address retrieval, and introduces syntax directed semantic actions in the C code to manage variable 
recognition, duplication checks, and memory assignments. Overall, this project enhances the calculator's functionality, making it more versatile and robust in handling 
variable-based calculations.
